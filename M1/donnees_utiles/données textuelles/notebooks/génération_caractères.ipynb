      "she remembered having seen in her brother's latin grammar, 'a mouse--of\n",
      "a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--o mouse!') the mouse looked at her rather\n",

      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n",

      "the poor animal's feelings. 'i quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",

      "\n",

      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! and it'll fetch things when\n",

      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n",
      "the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "so she called softly after it, 'mouse dear! do come back again, and we\n",

      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a duck and a dodo,\n",

      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "the next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "however, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",

      "bottle that stood near the looking-glass. there was no label this time\n",

      "it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",

      "down the bottle, saying to herself 'that's quite enough--i hope i shan't\n",

      "drunk quite so much!'\n",
      "\n",
      "alas! it was too late to wish that! she went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",

      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'it was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor alice, 'when one wasn't\n",

      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself 'this is bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",

      "\n",
      "the first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'there goes bill!'\n",

      "us all about it!'\n",
      "\n",

      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all i know is, something comes at me\n",

      "\n",
      "'so you did, old fellow!' said the others.\n",

      "'we must burn the house down!' said the rabbit's voice; and alice called\n",
      "out as loud as she could, 'if you do. i'll set dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to herself, 'i\n",
      "wonder what they will do next! if they had any sense, they'd take the\n",
      "roof off.' after a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "alice heard the rabbit say, 'a barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'a barrowful of what?' thought alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'i'll put a stop to this,'\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, 'you'd better not do that again!'\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. 'if i eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make\n",
      "some change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must\n",
      "make me smaller, i suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard, bill, was\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'the first thing i've got to do,' said alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
      "about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be\n",
      "the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'poor little thing!'\n",
      "said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",
      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
      "till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'and yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: 'i should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if i'd\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! oh dear! i'd nearly forgotten that\n",
      "i've got to grow up again! let me see--how is it to be managed? i\n",

      "\n",
      "the great question certainly was, what? alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "there was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\n",
      "that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\n",

      "have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\n",

      "you ought to tell me who you are, first.'\n",
      "\n",

      "here was another puzzling question; and as alice could not think of any\n",

      "perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. for some\n",
      "minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\n",

      "\n",

      "a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "'one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.'\n",
      "\n",

      "to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\n",
      "round, she found this a very difficult question. however, at last she\n",
      "stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\n",
      "of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'and now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\n",
      "blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",

      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'what can all that green stuff be?' said alice. 'and where have my\n",
      "shoulders got to? and oh, my poor hands, how is it i can't see you?'\n",
      "she was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",
      "except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\n",
      "tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\n",
      "neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. she had\n",
      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",
      "her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\n",
      "was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "'serpent!' screamed the pigeon.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'i've tried the roots of trees, and i've tried banks, and i've tried\n",

      "\n",
      "alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the pigeon had finished.\n",

      "\n",
      "'i'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "'and just as i'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the\n",
      "pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as i was thinking i\n",

      "the sky! ugh, serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'but i'm not a serpent, i tell you!' said alice. 'i'm a--i'm a--'\n",

      "invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'i--i'm a little girl,' said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "'a likely story indeed!' said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. 'i've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one\n",
      "with such a neck as that! no, no! you're a serpent; and there's no use\n",
      "denying it. i suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an\n",
      "egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'i have tasted eggs, certainly,' said alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'i don't believe it,' said the pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're\n",
      "a kind of serpent, that's all i can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'you're\n",
      "looking for eggs, i know that well enough; and what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'it matters a good deal to me,' said alice hastily; 'but i'm not looking\n",
      "for eggs, as it happens; and if i was, i shouldn't want yours: i don't\n",
      "like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'well, be off, then!' said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. after a while she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",

      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\n",

      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. the duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",

      "felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the hatter was the first to break the silence. 'what day of the month\n",

      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, 'it was the best butter,\n",
      "you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'what a\n",
      "funny watch!' she remarked. 'it tells the day of the month, and doesn't\n",

      "\n",

      "year it is?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'which is just the case with mine,' said the hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice felt dreadfully puzzled. the hatter's remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. 'i don't quite\n",
      "understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'the dormouse is asleep again,' said the hatter, and he poured a little\n",

      "now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. for instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\n",

      "\n",
      "'is that the way you manage?' alice asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",

      "\n",
      "'you can draw water out of a water-well,' said the hatter; 'so i should\n",

      "a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with\n",
      "a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an m, such as\n",

      "\n",

      "great disgust, and walked off; the dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\n",

      "\n",

      "alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",

      "\n",
      "the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",

      "\n",
      "by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't\n",
      "matter much,' thought alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.' so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",

      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite a\n",

      "the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",

      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "the executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\n",

      "turtle, and to hear his history. i must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions i have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving alice alone with\n",

      "\n",
      "'everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought alice, as she went slowly\n",

      "\n",
      "they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance,\n",

      "\n",
      "so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to\n",

      "him; and near the king was the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\n",
      "and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the court\n",
      "was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\n",
      "that it made alice quite hungry to look at them--'i wish they'd get the\n",
      "trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' but there\n",
      "seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\n",
      "her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. 'that's the judge,' she said to\n",
      "herself, 'because of his great wig.'\n",
      "\n",
      "the judge, by the way, was the king; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\n",
      "not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "'and that's the jury-box,' thought alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n",
      "(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) 'i suppose they are the jurors.' she said\n",
      "this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\n",
      "it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\n",
      "age knew the meaning of it at all. however, 'jury-men' would have done\n",
      "just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'what are they\n",

      "\n",
      "'they're putting down their names,' the gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\n",

      "\n",
      "'stupid things!' alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\n",
      "hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, 'silence in the court!' and the\n",
      "king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\n",
      "was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\n",

      "'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'a nice\n",
      "muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. this of course, alice\n",
      "could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. she did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was bill, the lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\n",
      "obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\n",
      "of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'herald, read the accusation!' said the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",

      "      all on a summer day:\n",
      "    the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts,\n",

      "blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'first witness!'\n",
      "\n",
      "the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one\n",
      "hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'i beg pardon, your\n",

      "was,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'fifteenth,' said the march hare.\n",

      "\n",
      "'write that down,' the king said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n",
      "wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n",
      "reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'take off your hat,' the king said to the hatter.\n",
      "\n",

      "my own. i'm a hatter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "here the queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the hatter,\n",

      "you executed on the spot.'\n",
      "\n",
      "this did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the queen, and in\n",
      "his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\n",
      "long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'i wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. 'i can hardly breathe.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'i can't help it,' said alice very meekly: 'i'm growing.'\n",

      "too.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace,' said the dormouse: 'not in that\n",
      "ridiculous fashion.' and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\n",
      "other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, 'bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on\n",

      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "'after that,' continued the hatter, 'i cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'but what did the dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "'you must remember,' remarked the king, 'or i'll have you executed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. 'i'm a poor man, your majesty,' he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "'you're a very poor speaker,' said the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (as that is rather a hard word, i will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. they had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'i'm glad i've seen that done,' thought alice. 'i've so often read\n",

      "queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",

      "a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\n",
      "upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\n",
      "they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\n",

      "\n",
      "'oh, i beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\n",

      "the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\n",
      "tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. she soon got\n",
      "it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said\n",
